Background:
    You are responsible for a website that has a lot of partners. Each partner daily receives a list of offers from your company. Unfortunately, each of them uses completely different systems that understand only certain data formats. 

Task:
    Write a program that would generate a list of offers and output them in a format based on output type specified in configuration. Format can be of any kind (XML, CSV, your custom format, etc.), but at least three different formats should be implemented.

Instructions:
    - This task has to be accomplished in PHP (Version 5.6 or greater).
    - It should be enough to update configuration to start using different output type.
    - Program can be run in an environment of your choice - web or CLI.
    - For sake of simplicity "offer" is a simple text string
